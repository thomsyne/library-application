# LibraryApplication

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10 and built with Tailwind version 2.0 for easy design scaffolding.

## Installing Packages

After cloning the application to your machine, run `npm install`. If you run into any errors, possibly due to compatibility issues, run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`. Once that is done. Move to the next step.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Thank you.
